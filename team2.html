			<div class="descrizione">As one traces the evolution our skating  team from its earliest foundation,
				Sk8 slave skateboarder Bitta has served as a visionary each step of the way. Since joining the team in 2013,
				he has remained unfadeable in both park skating as well as on the raw street level, all while never seeming to take any of it all that seriously. 
				The wheels are always in motion for Bitta even when off his board.
