      ABOUT US
    </div>
    <div class="txt">Sk8 slaves was born in 2012 from a desire to embrace the ever-shrinking subcultural side of skateboarding.
			The other kids always wanted to become football players, but we loved skateboarding, so we pursued the creativity and individuality 
			it has always bred and thrived on. At the time it seemed so strange and out of bounds, especially in a small city like Verona.
			Sk8 slaves started as a mean of creating something different for a small group of friends, and is still run exactly the same way today.
			We are still four grown up kids enjoying skateboarding together.
We believe a skateboard team should not be a collection of the skateboarders who are statistically or technically the best,
but a family of individuals that get you excited to ride your skateboard. Our team has not been assembled based on who is the best in tricks.
We believe that skateboarding is an amazing sport, and should be known as such by all the kids willing to begin a sport.
